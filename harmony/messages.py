=======================================================================
You must solve a CAPTCHA challenge.
You will be guided through the steps necessary to complete the challenge.
Press enter to start the challenge...
"""

INVALID_CAPTCHA = """\
The CAPTCHA token was not accepted.
This can happen even when all CAPTCHA challenges are successfully completed.
This is a known issue: https://github.com/taylordotfish/librecaptcha/issues/7
Sometimes, if you continue to solve CAPTCHAs, one will eventually be accepted.
However, this doesn't always seem to be the case. Please see the issue link
above if you'd like to help.
